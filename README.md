<h3>I ðŸ’™</h3>

- Playing games in my free time. I have had a deep love for gaming ever since I was young. I started to code because I wanted to edit the save files in games to get an unfair advantage and cheese them. My favorite game franchises are Assassin's Creed, Fallout, Counter Strike etc. I also play osu! a lot.

- Studying Chemistry and Physics. I know I'm bad at Mathematics so I love studying the subjects I'm good at to keep my anxiety in check.

- Watching Anime. I started watch anime ever since I was young and still enjoy it very much. My favorite anime is 86-Eighty Six-. I don't like watching TV shows because they are very sterile compared to anime. Plus, I can also read the manga or play the game to continue the story if it an adaptation which is nice.

- Reading books. I love reading books as it makes me feel more intelligent than I actually am. Reading books is one of the few times in the day I am away from a screen and is very refreshing. My favorite author is H.P.Lovecraft as I love his weird-science-fiction genre of books.

- Listening to music. Listening to music helps me to concentrate on a given task and to complete it efficently and without making any errors or mistakes. I love Pop and Rock songs. Jazz is very cool as well.

- Reading and going through blogs about coding and programming is really intresting to me because I know if I encounter a new way of doing a thing, I know I am trying it in a existing project of mine and see how it goes. It also helps to build up the programmer mindset.
